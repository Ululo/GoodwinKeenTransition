# GoodwinKeenTransition
This work is part of the GEMMES (Generalized Monetary Mutlisectoral Macrodynamics for the Ecological Shift) project, which aims at producing various macroeconomic models on specific issues (inequality, scarce resources, climate, energy, multisectoral policy analysis), all based on the Goodwin-Keen model :
- Richard M. Goodwin, 1967, "A Growth Cycle"
- Steve Keen, 1999, "Finance and economic breakdown: modeling Minsky's 'financial instability hypothesis'"

This research has been conducted under the supervision of GaÃ«l Giraud during an internship in the Chair Energy & Prosperity (http://chair-energy-prosperity.org/) in 2016-2017.

Here our specific aim is to describe the conditions of a transition to a low-carbon economy.
To do that we distinguish two types of capital goods : K^1 requires fossil energy as an input to produce output, whereas K^2 is a green capital stock.
Investment is allocated towards K^1 or K^2 depending on the energy price.
